Statement
To validate the challenge, connect as admin.

1. From the challenge's related resource, know that we need to find jwt token and change the algorithm to 'none'

2. Try to log in with random username and password. Look for headers on network tab of Chrome debugger. Not working

3. Click login as guest. Find the jwt token inthe header. We need to change this.
    As the related resources said, jwt token consists of 3 parts. 
    Type, Payload, and Signature
    If we change any type or payload or both, post-modified token's signature will not be the same with the signature calculated at first place
    -> Know that it's forgery.

4. We need to change the algorithm in type to be 'none'. Do this to disable signature authentication
    jwt token is encoded with base64. So decode it and change algo to 'none'.
    Also change the username from 'guest' to 'admin'

5. Combine modified jwt together, and replace it and forward it to the server. Use [Burp Suite]
    jwt format: base64(type).base64(payload).[no signature here as it's disable]
